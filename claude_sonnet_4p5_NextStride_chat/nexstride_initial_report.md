# NextStride Study: Background and Purpose

## 1. Background

### The Device: NextStride

NextStride is an innovative walking assist device designed to help individuals with mobility challenges walk with greater confidence and independence. The device attaches to standard mobility aids including walkers, canes, and trekking poles, making it highly versatile and accessible.

**Core Technology**

NextStride employs two forms of external cueing to address walking difficulties:

- **Visual Laser Line**: Projects a bright green laser line on the ground, providing users with a visual target for foot placement. This helps correct stride issues and gives the brain a clear spatial goal to focus on.

- **Audible Metronome**: Emits rhythmic audio signals that engage alternative neural pathways in the brain, helping users maintain a steady walking cadence.

**Mechanism of Action**

The device works by restoring the connection between brain and body movement. When automatic movement pathways are compromised due to neurological conditions or injury, NextStride enables users to shift from automatic commands to intention-based, goal-oriented commands. By utilizing functioning alternative neural pathways through visual and auditory cues, the device helps the nervous system transmit movement messages more effectively.

**Target Conditions and Benefits**

NextStride has demonstrated effectiveness for individuals experiencing:

- Freezing of gait (inability to initiate steps)
- Shuffling gait patterns
- Scissoring gait (foot crossing while walking)
- Balance difficulties and fall risk
- Problems with turning safely
- Fear of falling

The device has been validated through clinical case studies with major healthcare institutions including Vanderbilt, Bellevue Hospital, RiverSpring Living, and Paragon SNF. Its external cueing approach is supported by over 100 published research articles and is recognized as a standard of care in physical therapy practice.

**Ease of Use**

NextStride can be used in two modes: on-demand (activated during episodes of difficulty) or continuously (to prevent walking problems). Users can select either the laser light or metronome beeping based on their preferences and needs. The device comes with training videos, phone consultation support, and a 30-day money-back guarantee.

## 2. Study Purpose

The purpose of this study is to provide comprehensive information to a health plan that is considering offering NextStride access as a benefit to its subscribers. This evaluation requires gathering data on both intangible benefits and measurable cost outcomes.

**Primary Information Objectives**

The study aims to assess:

1. **Subscriber Goodwill and Satisfaction**: Understanding how offering NextStride as a benefit affects subscriber perception of the health plan, including:
   - Perceived value of innovative assistive device coverage
   - Satisfaction with health plan benefits
   - Member loyalty and retention implications
   - Differentiation from competing health plans

2. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Quantifying the financial impact of NextStride through:
   - Prevention of falls and fall-related injuries
   - Reduction in emergency department visits
   - Decreased hospitalization rates
   - Lower rehabilitation and long-term care costs
   - Maintenance of independence and delayed need for higher levels of care

**Critical Importance of Well-Defined Purpose**

Having a clearly articulated study purpose is essential for several reasons:

- **Data Collection Design**: The study's purpose directly informs which data elements need to be collected, what questions should be asked, and which outcomes should be measured. Without clear objectives, survey instruments may gather irrelevant information while missing critical data points.

- **Statistical Analysis Planning**: The hypotheses to be tested about population-level factors depend entirely on the study's goals. For instance, measuring subscriber satisfaction requires different analytical approaches than calculating cost savings from fall prevention.

- **Survey Instrument Development**: When questionnaires are employed, responses are typically used to compute underlying factor scores representing latent constructs (such as "satisfaction with benefits" or "confidence in mobility"). These factor scores are then analyzed to test hypotheses about factor levels in the study population. The specific factors that need to be measured must be determined by the study's purpose.

- **Resource Allocation**: A well-defined purpose ensures that limited resources (time, budget, respondent burden) are allocated efficiently to gather the most relevant and actionable information.

- **Stakeholder Communication**: Clear objectives facilitate effective communication with the health plan about what can and cannot be determined from the study, managing expectations appropriately.

## 3. Survey Design and Analysis: A Focused Bibliography

The following resources provide essential guidance on survey questionnaire design and statistical analysis, particularly as applied to customer expectations and satisfaction assessment:

### Core Methodology Reference
